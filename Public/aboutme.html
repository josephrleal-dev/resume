    <h2>Quick Bio:</h2>
    <p>My name is Joseph Rosenberger, and I was born in Monterrey, Mexico on May 30, 2007
        where I lived for the next 2 years. After that, I moved to
        the U.S. where me and my parents lived in an apartment 
        for a couple of months, then moved to a house where me and my 
        parents live today.
